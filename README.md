## Backers
Most of our libraries are built with our own effort at very small funding or just side projects.
However, maintaining binding libraries always takes a lot of time and effort.
Sometimes, people ask us for the latest version, we couldn't afford to upgrade for free due to many other higher prioritized works. Become a backer is the best way to help us always arrange resources to maintain (upgrade and fix issue) binding libraries.

## License

AccountKit binding library for iOS is released under the MIT license.
See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for details.
